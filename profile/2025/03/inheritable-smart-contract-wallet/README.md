## ðŸ“„ Summary

Inheritance of crypto assets in both cold and hot wallets remains a persistent challenge in decentralized finance. This audit focused on the `InheritanceManager` smart contract, which introduces a **time-locked inheritance system** for secure, decentralized, and automated distribution of assets to predefined beneficiaries.

Key features:
- Time-based locks to delay inheritance claims
- Beneficiary management with automatic distribution
- Elimination of intermediaries for estate planning
- Transparent and trustless inheritance mechanism
